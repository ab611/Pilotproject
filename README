So the new layout is pretty much what we talked about.

- jobs.py

    Each job option the user selects will have its own def() that we can pull from in main.py

- main.py

    Main body of program. Nothing here yet

- questions.py

    Will be where we store individual questions as a def(). Each question will need its own While loop
    to prevent user input errors.

    Have been playing around with adding generic responses that can open up stats, help files, etc

- responses.py

    Reference for all responses to questions. Figured it would be easier to put them all in one spot if we have
    to go back and change or add to them.

- scorekeeper.py

    file for all tracked score values throughout the game. Looking into figuring out how to make a script that will run
    only when certain point values are met. Example: If question 10 is "Delta invites your to interview" ... We only
    want that to run when interview points are above 90 and randomizer selects 'yes value'

-uservar.py

    File to keep track and reference unique user input

	Fixed lists, began work on beginning options. Mostly toying around with testing to 	to see if the "framework" will work. So far so good. Lemme know if its too 		scattered to follow. -Austin
