Started on the intro script to gather user info and bring up
options to review rules and list of commands. 
        Uservar.py is for user based variables
        questions.py is just for questions 
        intro.py is the script that I started on
        main.py is just where I figured we would merge all the sub scripts into one mess
        helpfile.py has the command list and rules in it. Want the command list to be accessible at any question in the game


Obviously this is still very early, but let me know what you think
